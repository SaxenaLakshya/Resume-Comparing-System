# Resume Summarization and Comparison System

Welcome to the **Resume Summarization and Comparison System**! This project allows you to summarize and compare resumes using Google's Gemini AI model. The program reads PDF files, summarizes their content based on education, projects, experience, and certifications/achievements, and even compares two resumes to suggest which candidate might be the best to hire.

## Features
